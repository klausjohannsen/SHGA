# Scaling Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Multimodal Optimization

This software is based on two software packages, which are included in this software in order make it a stand-alone software. The software packages have been modified slightly to fit the purpose. The software included is:
 * DEAP 1.3.1, published under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0
 * CMA 3.0.3, published under the BSD 3-Clause License

In addition, two benchmark-suits are included in this software:
 * CEC2013 [Li 2013], published under the FreeBSD License
 * CEC2015-Niching [Qu 2016]
